# Copilot Work-In-Progress

This folder contains development tracking documents and historical records of the codebase evolution. These are **not user-facing documents**—they track Copilot's work during development sessions.

## Current Contents

### Compliance & Review Documents
- **COMPLIANCE_REVIEW.md** - Comprehensive safety and quality compliance audit
  - 89-item checklist covering all architectural standards
  - Safety-critical analysis
  - Code quality assessment

### Progress Tracking
- **PROGRESS_REPORT.md** - Session-by-session development progress
  - Task completion tracking
  - Testing status updates
  - Quality metrics (test pass rates, coverage, pylint scores)

### Refactoring History
- **REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md** - Major code reorganization records
  - Monolithic-to-modular refactoring
  - Import structure changes
  - File organization updates

### Session Completion Reports
- **SESSION2_COMPLETION.md** - Detailed work session summaries
  - What was completed
  - What remains pending
  - Next steps

## Purpose

These documents help:
- **Track development progress** across multiple sessions
- **Document compliance** with safety-critical guidelines
- **Record architectural decisions** and their rationale
- **Provide context** when resuming work after breaks
- **Maintain institutional knowledge** of the codebase evolution

## Document Lifecycle

1. **Active Development** - Documents updated frequently during work sessions
2. **Completed Work** - Archived here when features are finished
3. **Historical Reference** - Used to understand past decisions and evolution

## Not for End Users

These documents are **internal development artifacts**. End users should reference:
- `docs/CV.md` - Configuration reference
- `docs/FUNCTIONS.md` - API documentation  
- `docs/capabilities.md` - Feature list

## Adding New WIP Documents

When creating new tracking documents:
- Use clear, descriptive names indicating content type
- Include date stamps for time-sensitive tracking
- Update this README with a brief description
- Archive to this folder when moving on to new work
