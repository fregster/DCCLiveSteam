# External References

This folder contains external specifications, standards, and third-party documentation referenced by the project.

## Current Contents

- **s-9.2.2_2012_10.pdf** - NMRA DCC Standard (S-9.2.2)
  - Digital Command Control (DCC) electrical and communication standards
  - Packet format specification
  - Timing requirements for DCC signal decoding

## Purpose

External references are **read-only** resources that provide:
- Industry standards compliance documentation
- Hardware component datasheets
- Protocol specifications
- Third-party API documentation

These documents are not created or modified by the project—they are authoritative sources from external organizations (NMRA, manufacturers, standards bodies).

## Adding New References

When adding new documents:
1. Use descriptive filenames (prefer original document names)
2. Include PDF datasheets for all hardware components
3. Note the source and version in this README
4. Do not modify external documents—reference them as-is
