# Gemini/Claude Instructions

This project uses a single unified instruction file to maintain consistency across all AI assistants and code generation tools.

**See: [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md)**

All guidance, best practices, safety requirements, and development workflows are documented in that file. Please refer to it for:

- Project architecture and structure
- Safety-critical requirements
- Testing and quality standards
- British English language requirements
- Configuration Variable (CV) and Function Number assignments
- Development workflow and task tracking
- Documentation standards

There are no separate instruction files. Use [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md) as the single source of truth for this project.
